## Package Organization

The configuration uses a package-based organization system for modular and maintainable code:

### Feature-based Packages
These packages provide cross-room functionality and system-wide features:
- **System Integration**: Assistant, notifications, presence, tablets
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Air quality, weather, weatherman
- **Entertainment**: Media music
- **Security**: Security
- **Device Management**: Appliances, default config

### Room-based Packages
These packages manage specific rooms and areas:
- **Living Areas**: Living room, kitchen, office, master bedroom
- **Bathrooms**: Master bathroom, downstairs bathroom, hallway bathroom
- **Passageways**: Hallway, downstairs hallway, stairway
- **Entry Points**: Front door, garage
- **Specialized Spaces**: Guest room, gym, server rack

## Package Dependencies

### Common Dependencies
- **Z-Wave JS**: Device communication and control
- **MQTT**: Message queuing and device discovery
- **Template Sensors**: Complex state calculations
- **Custom Blueprints**: Automation templates for specific devices

### Integration Dependencies
- **Harmony**: Entertainment system control (media_music)
- **Alarmo**: Advanced alarm system (security)
- **Noonlight**: Emergency response (security)
- **Ring**: Alarm system integration (security)
- **Adaptive Lighting**: Lighting automation (multiple packages)

## Usage Guidelines

### Package Configuration
- Each package is self-contained with its own entities, automations, and scripts
- Packages use YAML anchors for consistent configuration
- Custom attributes store package-specific information
- Package dependencies are clearly documented

### Automation Patterns
- **Blueprint Usage**: Many packages use custom blueprints for device-specific automation
- **Template Sensors**: Complex state tracking and calculations
- **Event-Driven**: Automation based on state changes and events
- **Occupancy-Based**: Intelligent control based on room occupancy

### Best Practices
- **Modular Design**: Each package focuses on specific functionality
- **Consistent Naming**: Entity names follow consistent patterns
- **Documentation**: Each package includes comprehensive documentation
- **Cross-References**: Packages reference related files and blueprints
